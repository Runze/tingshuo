title: What is 听说?

> *Imagination is not only the uniquely human capacity to envision that which is not, and therefore the fount of all invention and innovation. In its arguably most transformative and revelatory capacity, it is the power that enables us to empathise with humans whose experiences we have never shared.*

## What's in the name?

听说, pronounced as *tingshuo*, is a Chinese expression meaning to hear, or more precisely, to hear something from the mouth of someone else. There is a sense of casualness and authenticity in it and an accompanying lack of validity and authority.

## What's the goal of the project?

The goal is to encourage a deeper understanding of a foreign culture by listening to the locals speak for themselves. I started this project because, being an immigrant myself, I had often been frustrated by the misunderstandings and stereotypes that people, aided by the media, had developed of my own culture and country. I wanted to constantly remind people that, like them, we are individuals each with our own opinions, we don't represent an organization, a government, or an ideology, and it will all become evident if you listen to us.

## Why podcasts?

Because, simply put, I found few resources better than them. For example, if you are curious about what occupies the minds of the people in China, tune in to podcasts like [StoryFM](http://storyfm.cn/), who paints a vivid picture of the dynamic society through real stories told by ordinary people. Soon, you'll learn that many of us are caught between a rapidly developing country and a deeply traditional society, occupied by questions like how to survive in a megacity like Beijing, how to take care of the elderly who are left behind, and how to balance the western values like independence and freedom with our traditional emphasis on communities and families. In the end, I hope you will conclude that, yes, due to cultural and political differences, we are undeniably different, but at the end of the day, the physical borders that divide us only manage to create a multitude of parallel universe, in which we are in fact comically and encouragingly all the same.

## How do we do it?

But obviously, there stands in between a strong language barrier and this is what this project tries to overcome. Thanks to the advancement in speech recognition and machine translation, it is now possible to transcribe and translate a foreign podcast into another language while maintaining the general idea of the original story. However, this general idea falls short of retelling the story in its entirety and often misinterprets the plot, so we compensate it by manually correcting the transcript and translation ourselves. In the end, our goal is to retell a story faithfully in English by minimizing the cultural nuances that risk being lost in machine translation.

The work easily requires a great amount of effort and as of now, we are a one-person team including only me. I cannot possibly translate all the podcasts in the world, nor do I have expertise in all the languages. Hence, the only fully translated podcasts available in the [website](/transcripts/) now are a few select ones that have left a big impression on me, and this is why I need your help.

## How can you help?

Since you have ended up on this website, you are probably a fan of podcasts too. If you are also passionate about educating the rest of the world on your cultures and languages, please reach out to me at [email]. I can certainly use your help to select content and correct the machine-generated transcript and translation. I believe the majority of us, when given an opportunity, are interested in learning and hearing from each other, but various barriers make it hard to empathize with those who do not reside in our immediate community. So let's make it easier.
