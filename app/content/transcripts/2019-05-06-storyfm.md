你好，欢迎收听故事FM。我是爱哲，一个收集故事的人。在这里，我们用你的声音，讲述你的故事。每周一、三、五，咱们不见不散。

<span style="color:grey">Hello, welcome to Story FM. I am Aizhe, someone who collects stories. Here, we use your voice to tell your stories. Every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, we hope to see you here.</span>

就在上个月，我们播出了一位移民澳洲的听众在异国他乡打拼的故事。那一期节目的结尾，我们发起了一次征集，请大家分享自己在海外生活的故事。其实故事FM自从开播以来一直都有相当比例的海外听众。他们或者是移民，或者是留学生，或者是因为工作和家庭的原因暂时旅居在异国他乡。在那些陌生的文化环境下，尴尬、冲突和包容都会自然而然的发生，哪怕最普通的生活日常都能成为有趣的回忆。

<span style="color:grey">Last month, we told a story of a listener who had immigrated to Australia and how he had worked hard in the foreign country. At the end of that episode, we asked everyone to share your own story of living abroad. In fact, since the beginning of Story FM, we have always had a considerable number of overseas listeners. They are either immigrants, international students, or those who temporarily live in a foreign country for work and family reasons. In the unfamiliar cultural environments, awkwardness, conflicts, and tolerance can all arise naturally, and even the most common everyday life can later become an interesting piece of memory.</span>

今天的第一个故事发生在15年前，他的讲述者是一位70后，名字叫陆燕。2004年她曾以访问学者的身份前往加拿大魁北克参与了一次为期一年的学术交流活动。

<span style="color:grey">The first story today happened 15 years ago. The narrator is called Lu Yan, who was born in the 1970s. In 2004, she traveled to Quebec, Canada as a visiting scholar to participate in a one-year academic exchange program.</span>

我印象特深：1月10号答辩，1月14号我就飞到McGill了。最冷的那一天，那是2004年的1月14号。体感温度-40度。想想跟做梦一样，真的跟做梦一样。

<span style="color:grey">I remember it very well: I finished my dissertation on January 10 and flew to McGill on January 14. It was January 14th, 2004, the coldest day of the year with a temperature of -40 degrees. It felt like a dream. Really like a dream.</span>

接受我的那教授挺好的。他会告诉我说你应该穿什么衣服什么的。到那以后出来吧，我挺感动的，他从同事那借来的围脖、大衣。他怕我不知道那儿那么冷嘛，全准备好了，接着我去学校。

<span style="color:grey">The professor who accepted me was very nice. He had told me what clothes to wear in advance. Arriving at the airport, I was very touched to find him carrying the neck-warmer and coat that he borrowed from his colleagues because he was afraid that I didn't know how cold it was. Once I was all ready, he drove me to school.</span>

就去学校呢，我这人说话快，即便英文不太好，我说话也快，说英文也快。但我听力那时候很多听不懂，但我说话快，所以教授就以为我什么都听得懂。然后他就说有个给你的一个guestroom。这好像听懂了，因为我之前也去搜索了一些，好像有时候有些教授会给你安排一些客房。

<span style="color:grey">Once at school, I spoke very fast even though my English was in fact not very good. However, I couldn't understand a lot when it was my turn to listen, but because I spoke so fast, the professor still thought I understood everything. At one point, he told me he had prepared a guestroom for me, which I understood because, thanks to my prior research, I learned that some professors would indeed prepare guestrooms for visiting scholars.</span>

我说：“哦，那挺好的。”我说：“那这谁pay啊？Who pay?” 那时候就会说几个词。可有意思了！"Who pay?" 

<span style="color:grey">So I said, "that's great! But who pay?" At that time, I could only string a few words together. It was hilarious.</span>

他说了一串，我也听不懂谁pay。我说：“是不是I pay？是不是我pay？我花钱？”

<span style="color:grey">He replied a bunch, but I still didn't understand who was going to pay. So I tried again, "Is it I pay?"</span>

他说："No," 不是。

<span style="color:grey">He said no.</span>

我说：“那who pay啊？”我又问谁pay了。

<span style="color:grey">I asked, "then who pay?"</span>

他又说了一串。我说：“是不是您pay啊？”

<span style="color:grey">Again, he said a bunch of words. I tried again, "Is it you pay?"</span>

他说也不是他pay。

<span style="color:grey">He said no.</span>

我说：“爱谁pay谁pay！”

<span style="color:grey">"Then whatever!"</span>

我就再跟他确认一下：“是不是我不用pay？”

<span style="color:grey">I checked with him one more time, "is it correct that I don't need to pay?"</span>

“你不用pay。”

<span style="color:grey">He assured me that I didn't.</span>

我说：“Okay! 那就住吧。”

<span style="color:grey">I was relieved. "Okay! I'll stay here then."</span>

我说：“那住多久呢？”

<span style="color:grey">I asked him, "how long can I stay there?"</span>

听的大概意思吧，好像你能住到什么时候都没关系，你找到就行。

<span style="color:grey">From what I was able to grasp, he seemed to be saying that I could stay however long I wished once I found it.</span>

当时是这边的高校组织的那个联合会给我们办的这些，就是加拿大政府给我们钱这个，人给了我们一个250块钱的一个money order，现金支票吧。我也不知道这是现金支票，但是我问了一下他说这是可以当钱使的。我说：“好，当钱使。”我就拿着这钱就来了，其他什么都没带。

<span style="color:grey">Before coming to Canada, with the help of the university, the Canadian government gave each of us a money order of $250, which I think is a cash check. I didn't actually know that this was a cash check, but someone had told me that I could use it as money, so I came here with only this, nothing else.</span>

来了之后才发现你得先去银行开户。银行开户啊，怎么开啊？我还碰到个本科生，一个中国学生，她带我第一次去银行。在我们那最近的就是BMO银行。去了之后呢，她说你需要的说了好多我也听不懂。

<span style="color:grey">However, once here, I found out that I had to go to a bank to open an account first. I had no idea how to open a bank account. Luckily, I met a Chinese undergraduate student, who took me to the closest BMO bank for the first time. At the bank, she tried to explain to me what I needed to open an account. She said a lot and frankly, I didn't understand much.</span>

我说：“到底需要什么呀？”

<span style="color:grey">I asked, "what exactly do I need?"</span>

“你需要好多材料。你需要SIN卡，就是我们的工卡。”

<span style="color:grey">"You need a lot of documents. For example, you need a SIN card, which is our work permit."</span>

我说：“这是干什么用的呀？”英文不过关不懂啊。

<span style="color:grey">Failing to understand her, I asked helplessly, "what is that for?"</span>

然后他就说：“你去系里问一下，去你们学校问。他们应该知道。”

<span style="color:grey">So she told me, "go ask your department at school. They should know."</span>

我说：“去去去，去问。”

<span style="color:grey">So I did.</span>

问了之后我问中国人，然后他就说：“这工卡必须给办，相当于咱们的身份证，要工作必须得有。你开银行账户号也需要。”

<span style="color:grey">After asking a Chinese, he told me: "you need to have a work permit. It's like our ID card. You need one to work and also to open a bank account."</span>

我说：“拿护照不行吗？”

<span style="color:grey">I asked, "I can't use my passport for it?"</span>

“护照人不给你开。”

<span style="color:grey">"They won't accept your passport."</span>

“申请多长时前？”

<span style="color:grey">"How long does the application take"</span>

“三周来。”

<span style="color:grey">"3 weeks."</span>

三周来我吃什么？没钱呢！因为你没有账户，人家加拿大政府没法把钱打到账户上。我就跟他申请先给我一些现金过来。

<span style="color:grey">3 weeks! What would I be eating for 3 weeks? I have no money! Without a bank account, the Canadian government can't transfer any money to me. So I asked him to give me some cash first.</span>

他说：“不行。我们只能打到你账户上。”

<span style="color:grey">He said, "No. We can only transfer money to your account."</span>

但是不行啊，那会饿死的！怎么办呢？

<span style="color:grey">But it's impossible! I'll die of hunger! What can I do?</span>

这会儿我就想起了拿的250块钱，那个现金支票。我说：“这怎么用啊？”

<span style="color:grey">Remembering my $250 cash check, I asked, "how do I use this?"</span>

他说：“你到市中心，那有那种可以拿这换钱的，可以换成现金。”

<span style="color:grey">He told me, "Go to the city center. There you will find a place to convert it to cash."</span>

我说：“行，我去换！”

<span style="color:grey">"Okay, I'll go there!"</span>

到那之后人家收我12.5%的手续费。我也不知道，我说：“挺好，挺好！”赶紧拿这200多块钱嘛。至少先吃饭吧！你知道我来了以后三天没吃什么饭！我光从家里带了点栗子吃了三天，给我饿得半死，我跟你说！没饭吃！

<span style="color:grey">There they charged me a processing fee of 12.5%, but I didn't care. I kept saying "good, good!" and took the money in a hurry. At least I could eat now! You know, I hadn't eaten anything for three days! Before coming here, I took a few chestnuts from my house and I had been only eating *them* for three days. I almost died of hunger, I'm telling you!</span>

可能我们的同事都看出来了。就是我们的办公室当时除了我还有另外一个中国人，当时在那读博士，其他人都是老外。还有一个日本的一个来留学的一个女孩子。虽然语言我们都不太通（我不太通），人家看出来我肯定是没饭吃。连比划带说的，那日本女孩住在我们楼上的公寓楼（就是我们那个客房——给我安排的那个客房）。她就把我叫到我楼上。

<span style="color:grey">Maybe my colleagues had all seen it. In my office, besides me, there was another Chinese who was doing a Ph.D and everyone else was a foreigner. Among us, there was also a Japanese girl. Despite the language barrier, they must have realized that I had nothing to eat. Using words and gestures, the Japanese girl, who was living in the same apartment building that houses my guestroom, called me upstairs.</span>

我说：“干嘛啊？”

<span style="color:grey">I asked her, "what do we do?"</span>

她说给我下点意大利面条，“你吃这个，你吃这个！”

<span style="color:grey">She said she would prepare some spaghetti for me. "Eat these! Eat these!"</span>

我说：“我吃！”没得吃，这吃得挺好。

<span style="color:grey">So I did. Without nothing else to eat, I had quite a meal.</span>

你知道那去银行为什么呢？他说要我SIN卡，我就去申请呗，三周才能到。好不容易眼巴巴等到三周了！而且那两周的时候我就不好意思老住在人家那客房。其实我现在想想当时住一两个月都没关系的。就一直帮助我那个本科生的那女孩呢，帮我付了一个月的租金。又碰到好人，你知道吗？特别着急要把银行账户得开开来，要不钱怎么还人家，对不对？

<span style="color:grey">As for the SIN card, it took 3 weeks to arrive. Finally, the three weeks had passed! I had already felt embarrassed to keep staying in the guestroom. In fact, now that I think about it, it wouldn't matter even if I had stayed for a month or two. The undergraduate girl who had been helping me had paid a month's rent for me. You see, I met a good person again! I was particularly anxious to open a bank account to pay her back.</span>

我兴冲冲就去了，拿着系里的介绍信，拿着我那工卡去了。挺高兴，这回行了！

<span style="color:grey">So I hurried to the bank, carrying with me the introduction letter from my department and my work permit, feeling certain that I would finally have my account.</span>

我说：“给我开吧！”

<span style="color:grey">So I said, "Please open an account for me."</span>

他说：“No. 你的护照！”

<span style="color:grey">The clerk replied, "No, we need your passport."</span>

我说：“哎呦，我忘了。你先给我开，开完之后一会我马上回去就给你拿。”

<span style="color:grey">Taken aback, I replied, "Oh I forgot about it! Please just open one for me now and I'll bring you my passport right after."</span>

那个年轻人就是不给我开。我就火了，我很生气啊！我饿了好几天了，说实话。然后又不给我开，我的钱到不了户，我还欠人家钱！

<span style="color:grey">The young man just wouldn't do it for me and I became very angry. Honestly, I had been hungry for days. Without an account, my money would not be transferred to me and I still owe money to other people!</span>

我说：“找你的manager！”我发现人急的时候英文特流。

<span style="color:grey">So I demanded: "Let me talk to your manager!" I realized that I always became quite fluent in English when triggered.</span>

经理出来看我生气了，我就跟他说这个情况。我说：“你看我现在其实都全了，就差这几分钟，你先帮我开了，我赶紧告诉人家把钱给我打进来，我把钱该还的还、该吃饭的吃饭，对不对啊？我回去把护照一定给你。上次我都给你看过我的护照，我不是骗你们的！”

<span style="color:grey">When the manager came out, I explained to him about the situation. I said, "You see, I am almost done now. It just takes a few minutes. Please just open an account for me now so that I can have my money transferred to me. I need it to repay people and to buy food! I promise I'll come back with my passport later. Besides, I have already shown you my passport last time. You know I am not lying to you!"</span>

那个经理说：“好，没问题，我现在马上给你办！”

<span style="color:grey">After hearing me, the manager said, "Okay, no problem. We'll open an account for your right now!"</span>

我说：“这太好了！”

<span style="color:grey">I exclaimed, "That's great!"</span>

他说：“你不要生气。你坐。”

<span style="color:grey">"Don't be upset. Please sit down."</span>

他说：“你开的这个账户是checking还是saving？”

<span style="color:grey">He continued, "Are you opening a checking or a saving account?"</span>

我说：“什么意思啊？”我不懂。其实它是帐户类型嘛。“干嘛的？”

<span style="color:grey">"What do you mean?" I didn't understand the different account types. "What are they for?"</span>

他就说了半天我也听不懂。

<span style="color:grey">He explained a while but I still didn't understand.</span>

我说：“你收我钱吗？”

<span style="color:grey">So I asked, "Will it cost me anything?"</span>

“不收。”

<span style="color:grey">"No."</span>

“那开吧开吧。”

<span style="color:grey">"Then just open them."</span>

开了。

<span style="color:grey">And so they were opened.</span>

然后他说：“你要不要信用卡？”

<span style="color:grey">Then he asked, "Do you need a credit card?"</span>

我说：“干什么的啊？”那时候在国内没用过信用卡。

<span style="color:grey">"What's that for?" I had never used a credit card in China before.</span>

他说：“就是信用卡。”说了半天我也听不懂。

<span style="color:grey">"It's just a credit card." He tried to explain again but I still didn't understand.</span>

我说：“你让我付钱吗？”

<span style="color:grey">So I asked again, "Will it cost me anything?"</span>

“不付钱。”

<span style="color:grey">"No."</span>

“开吧开吧。”

<span style="color:grey">"Then open it."</span>

“你要美元账户吗？”

<span style="color:grey">"Do you need an account for US dollars?"</span>

“我不付钱吧？”

<span style="color:grey">"Will it cost me anything?"</span>

“不付。”

<span style="color:grey">"No."</span>

“开！”

<span style="color:grey">"Then open it!"</span>

“要美元信用卡吗？”

<span style="color:grey">"And a credit card for the US dollars?"</span>

“不付钱？开！”

<span style="color:grey">"Free? Sure!"</span>

全开了。开了不知道是干什么的，但当时挺高兴的。

<span style="color:grey">And so they opened everything for me. I had no idea what they were for, but I still felt very happy.</span>

他说：“那你回去把你的护照拿来就行。我们看一下、留存一下就行了。”

<span style="color:grey">In the end, he told me, "Just bring back your passport and we'll take a look and make a copy. Then it's all done."</span>

我就挺高兴的，开心的不行！赶紧打电话，然后钱就到位了。

<span style="color:grey">"I was elated! I made a few phone calls right away and my money was finally transferred to me."</span>

刚开始那段时间，我就会觉得怎么会饿的呢？三十多岁了也没饿过。当时给我的感觉就是，出来以后虽然也遇到一些挫折，但是还是好人多吧。所以也影响到我后来对别人，尽量能帮的我就帮一把。因为你困难的时候这种……你将心比心嘛，都不容易。

<span style="color:grey">During those early days, I used to wonder how I could ever feel so hungry. I had never been hungry in my entire thirty years of life! I felt that, although I had encountered a few setbacks after leaving my familiar environment, I had also met many good people. The experience taught me to always help others whenever I could. Because when people are in trouble... you need to put yourself in their shoes. It's not easy for anyone.</span>

那时候就是稀里糊涂的就开始，然后教授就约见嘛。当时一月份，他说你在3月初要做一个演讲，就是你在中国做的研究。

<span style="color:grey">I started my program in a daze. The professor met me in January and told me to prepare a speech about my research in China in early March.</span>

我想：“哎呦，这玩意怎么弄啊？语言还没过关呢？”

<span style="color:grey">I said to myself, "How can I do that? I'm still not good enough in English yet!"</span>

我说：“你看能不能几个月以后？我得准备准备吧。”做45分钟的演讲，然后15分钟还得大家来提问。这怎么能做得了？语言都不灵啊！

<span style="color:grey">So I asked, "Can I have a few more months? I need to prepare it after all." The speech would last 45 minutes with a Q&A in the end. It's impossible with my level of English!</span>

“那不行，就得这周做。”

<span style="color:grey">"No, it has to be that week."</span>

我就开始跟那些同事——因为基本都是老外，只有一个中国人嘛——我就问：“你们谁家有party啊？”我就去。还住在犹太人家——就是你不要住在中国社区啊，要不你语言提高不了。这逼着你就得说英文！

<span style="color:grey">So I started to ask my colleagues, who were basically all native speakers except one, if any of them were going to throw a party. If they were, I would go. Besides, I had also been living in a Jewish household - you don't want to live in a Chinese community, or your English will never improve. Living with locals forces you to speak English!</span>

到人家里后我就不停的找人说。全是错的，那也得说。那帮人就在那儿乐。我说：“我说的是不是不对？”

<span style="color:grey">Once arriving at a party, I would start talking nonstoppingly. I must have made tons of mistakes, but I still had to keep going. Everyone was laughing. I asked, "Did I said something wrong?"</span>

他们说：“你非常好！”他们都表扬我。他们说：“你是个非常talkative的person。”

<span style="color:grey">Instead they praised me, "No, you speak very well! You are a very talkative person."</span>

我不懂这个词，我说：“Talkative? 这是个什么意思呢？”

<span style="color:grey">I didn't understand that word, so I asked, "Talkative? What does it mean?"</span>

“就是说你说话很多。”

<span style="color:grey">"It means you speak a lot."</span>

“这是个好词还是个不好的词呢？”

<span style="color:grey">"Is it a good word or a bad one?"</span>

他们说：“这是个挺好的词！”

<span style="color:grey">"It's a pretty good one!"</span>

“那你们就随便可以说我这个词，没问题。”

<span style="color:grey">"Oh, in the case, no problem. You can keep calling me that."</span>

但他们会说：“你和别的中国人不太一样，他们都非常的礼貌，polite。”

<span style="color:grey">But they would also say, "You are different from the other Chinese. They are all very polite."</span>

我说：“我也很礼貌！”

<span style="color:grey">I objected, "I'm also very polite!"</span>

“但你就可以跟别人这样主动去讲话。”

<span style="color:grey">"But only you would take the initiative to talk with the others."</span>

“我不主动讲话我过不了关，我怎么做那演讲呢？”一个月后就得做那个演讲，开玩笑！多少人来听你的，你在上面卡壳怎么办呢？

<span style="color:grey">"If I don't do this, my English won't improve. How can I give my talk then?" I needed to give my talk in a month, no kidding! There would be so many people coming to listen, what would I do if I was lost in words?</span>

那时候我搬到一个犹太人家里面。那犹太人老太太——爱哟，我的妈呀——可抠门了！不能和她的水，你能想象吗？你得夹着尾巴做人！她那个饮水机呀，少一杯水她都知道！我没喝过她的水，因为你刚刚住到她那儿的时候，她就给你讲明白，这个饮水机只是她来喝水的，我是不能喝那个水的，我只能喝水管里的水。

<span style="color:grey">At that time I stayed in a Jewish household. The old lady - oh my God - was so stingy! She told me not to drink her water, can you imagine? I had to watch my every step! She had a water dispenser and she could tell if someone had taken even a glass of water from it! Personally, I had never drunk her water because as soon as I moved in, she had told me very clearly that the water dispenser was only for her. I couldn't drink that water. I could only drink from the tap.</span>

就有一天她的那个小时工来，人家干完活回来喝了一杯水还是两杯水。到了晚上她回来说我偷喝她的水了。

<span style="color:grey">One day, she had a few hourly workers come in. Once they finished their work, they took a couple glasses of water from the dispenser. When she came back in the evening, she accused me of drinking her water.</span>

“我怎么会偷喝你的水呢？”我发现我一急的时候英文就特好，“你不能侮辱我！”那个词当时我也想起来了，平时都想不到这些词。

<span style="color:grey">"How can I drink your water?" As usual, my English improved dramatically when I was upset. "You can't insult me like this!" I even remembered the word "insult"! I would have never thought of these words in normal times.</span>

我说：“我说不喝我就不喝，但是说实话，我认为你这个不让别人喝水这个事情我不认同。你要向我道歉！” Apology我都会说了！

<span style="color:grey">I continued, "When I told you I wouldn't drink your water, I meant it. But honestly, I don't like that you forbid anyone from drinking it. You need to apologize to me!" I even remember the word "apology"!</span>

我这么说完之后那老太太反而愣了。我发现人都是欺软怕硬，尤其是老外有时候会有点这种。跟他们在这个争论的过程中，你就得想方设法把那些仅有点的词用出来，回来还得再去补充那些词。你得想着怎么跟他们下一步斗争。

<span style="color:grey">After I finished, the lady was stunned. In fact, I found that many people simply bully the weak and fear the strong, especially the foreigners at times. When arguing with them, you have to find ways to make the most use of your limited vocabulary and replenish it with new ones later. You have to think about how to argue with them next.</span>

到三月初，系里的同学、老师们全来了。来了50多个人，挺多的。挺大的一个教室，我就开始讲我在中国做的那些民族医药的一些研究，图片什么都有。我还挺能讲，讲了四十多分钟，讲完之后大家觉得挺有意思的。

<span style="color:grey">Finally, March comes. All my classmates and teachers from the department came to attend my talk. More than 50 people in total, which was quite a lot. In a big classroom, with pictures and all that, I started to talk about the research that I did in China, which was on Chinese medicine. In fact, I was rather "talkative" and spoke for more than forty minutes straight. The audience found it quite interesting.</span>

挺老远的一个人就向我提问。你那么老远，我听得懂吗？不来听力就不好，问了一个什么问题我根本就听不懂啊！

<span style="color:grey">Someone asked me a question from afar. You were so far away, how could I understand you? I was already bad at understanding spoken English, there was no way I could get the question!</span>

我说：“Okay, 这个问题我来转给我的教授，让他来帮我回答。”

<span style="color:grey">So I said, "Okay, I'll pass this question to my professor. He will help me answer it."</span>

我心想：“你让我做了40多分钟的演讲了，还让我再回答问题？可以了，你帮我去回答问题吧，我都没听懂。”

<span style="color:grey">I thought to myself, "You've just made me give a forty-minute talk and now you are going to make me answer all the questions? That's it, you help me answer them, which I didn't even understand."</span>

我的教授挺好的，他就帮我拿过去，就帮我来回答问题。凡是问题我听不懂的我就转给教授——邀请我来的那个教授。

<span style="color:grey">My professor was quite good and answered it for me. From then on, whenever I didn't understand a question, I would pass it to my professor, the one who invited me here.</span>

结束之后我那教授特高兴，因为他邀请我来的，他觉得挺有面子。刚来一个多月，做演讲还挺成功的。

<span style="color:grey">After the talk had ended, my professor was very pleased. It was him who invited me to come so he felt quite proud that, after only a little over a month, I managed to give a rather successful talk.</span>

来到加拿大的第二年，陆燕阴差阳错的拿到了加拿大的永久居留权，目前她定居在渥太华。

<span style="color:grey">In her second year, Lu Yan somehow obtained her permanent residency in Canada and is now living in Ottawa.</span>

第二个故事同样发生在北美洲，他的讲述者是一个30多岁的年轻人。

<span style="color:grey">The second story also took place in North America, whose narrator is a young man in his 30s.</span>

我叫只穿白鞋，因为我除了平时上班就真的只穿白鞋。

<span style="color:grey">I call myself Only-Wearing-White-Shoes because, except at work, I only wear white shoes.</span>

我现在生活在美国马里兰州，我是2010年出去的美国，然后到的城市叫纽瓦克，是在特拉华州。

<span style="color:grey">I live in Maryland, USA. I came to America in 2010. My first city here was Newark, Delaware.</span>

然后是因为大学我跟我太太，当时我们一起大学毕业之后她拿到这个全额奖学金赴美读博士。我就是学渣那个类型的，大学里面就挂科无数，差点没拿到学位证的样子，所以我根本没有机会就是靠学术能力出国。加上了来自这个工薪家庭，要砸钱流血就更不可能。根本没有机会跟她一起出去。

<span style="color:grey">I came with my wife, who, upon our graduation, received a full scholarship to a Ph.D. program in the US. On the contrary, I used to be a bad student who, after failing so many classes at college, almost failed to receive a diploma. Therefore, I had no chance to go abroad for academic reasons. In addition, I came from a working family, which made financing my trip even more impossible. As a result, it is out of the question for me to go with her at all.</span>

最后实在想不到，反而是我女友提议要不先去半年，然后半年后回来结婚，然后我再拿这个配偶签证一起赴美。

<span style="color:grey">In the end, incredibly, my girlfriend proposed to first go there herself for half of a year, and then come back to get married to me so that I could go back with her on a family visa.</span>

当然就是可以料到了她父母听到这个消息多么崩溃啊，就是因为自己这么优秀一个女儿要跟一个在国内工作还没有着落，然后来自普通家庭的男生结婚，搁在哪个家长身上估计都愁的谎。

<span style="color:grey">Of course, you can imagine how surprised her parents were upon hearing the proposal, seeing their perfect daughter marrying a working-class boy who still hadn't find a job in China yet. Any parents would be worried.</span>

我是做了很多口头和书面的保证，也详详细细的多次讲了我们赴美的计划。怎么讲，就是安排的再好其实我觉得很难撼动她父母那种焦虑的心，最终还是我觉得他们女儿下了杀手锏，就说可能是说非我不嫁之类的。我也不知道。

<span style="color:grey">To convince her parents, I had given them a lot of verbal and written promises and explained to them in detail about our plan for America many times too. In fact, I felt no matter how comprehensive our plan was, it was still very difficult to dispell the anxiety of her parents. In the end, I think it was still their daughter who dropped the bomb by saying that she would marry no one but me. I don't know.</span>

是10年初一月份，我们扯了证之后，然后办了相关手续，然后我就拿着家里尽力给我准备的3万块人民币，然后就走了。

<span style="color:grey">In January 2010, we received our marriage certificate and requested the immigration documents. With the 30,000 RMB that my family had scrambled together for me, I left for America.</span>

初期来讲，因为就是没有办法申请学校，然后成绩太差，然后因为是配偶签证也没有办法工作，我们的计划就是我在那里准备考托福和GRE，在她的实验室可能能找到一份志愿者的工作，这样的话我就可以积累一些经验，然后最后看能不能混到一分推荐信。

<span style="color:grey">In the beginning, due to my poor grades, I couldn't apply to any school. And because I couldn't work on a family visa either, the plan was for me to study for TOEFL and GRE while trying to find a volunteering position in her lab to build some experience and eventually receive a recommendation letter.</span>

我从实验室最开始的时候就是打砸。实验室有些实验器材，我就把它们放好安排好，然后有一些实验设备需要就是清理还是什么的。慢慢的我就会开始学习做一些实验，比说养细胞、提取蛋白。到最后能做一些比较复杂一点的一些实验，比如说聚合酶链式反应、液相色谱。到最后就是大部分实验室用到的器材，我其实都能独立操作。

<span style="color:grey">I started by doing random things in the lab, such as arranging and cleaning the equipment. Little by little, I would start to learn to do some experiments, such as raising cells and extracting proteins. Later on, I could handle more complicated ones like polymerase chain reaction and liquid chromatography. In the end, I was able to operate independently most of the equipment in the lab .</span>

我当时申请的就是我老婆的那个系——生物化学。但是实在是因为背景不是很好，和其他申请人相比就是没有什么优势，所以生物化学系其实是拒绝我了。但是有一个生物系的教授的一个合作的项目，是跟我老婆他们实验室合做的。那个课程，其实是我在做。我知道生化系没有希望的时候，我就问他有没有可能在他实验室继续干。就没想到他就很爽快同意了，所以2011年秋天的时候我就成为了生物系的研究生。

<span style="color:grey">I applied for biochemistry, which was my wife's major. But because my background was really not that good and I had no advantage compared to the other applicants, I got rejected by the department. However, I happened to be working on a project that was owned jointly by a biology professor and my wife's lab. When I knew that I had no chance to get into biochemistry, I asked the professor if it was possible for me to continue to work in his lab. Without hesitation, he replied yes, which I didn't expect. As a result, I became a graduate student in the biology department in the fall of 2011.</span>

那个时候我觉得打过几次电话，就当我老婆给他爸妈说我已经申请到了时候，我觉得能听出他们的其实语气有一些转变。就说就还行，就还不是个烂仔。承诺的事情至少第一步还是做到了。

<span style="color:grey">When my wife called her parents and told them that I got into the biology department, I could sense that the tone of their voice had changed. It seemed they realized that I was not that bad after all and that I had taken at least the first step in the things that I had promised.</span>

到这个时候呢，我觉得算是过了来美之后最大的一个坎儿吧。因为家里又多了一份奖学金的收入，所以生活比之前要轻松很多了。

<span style="color:grey">By then, I felt I had crossed the biggest hurdle after coming to America. Now that we had another scholarship as a source of income, our life had become much easier than before.</span>

白鞋说来美国前他当了20多年的学渣，从来没有想过自己会走上学术的道路，更没想过自己能靠读书在异国他乡站稳脚跟。研究生毕业之后，他决定跨专业申请统计学的研究生，这样更容易获得实习和工作的机会。但是经过一番努力之后，他没能拿到统计学的全额奖学金。高昂的学费让夫妻俩左右为难。

<span style="color:grey">White-Shoes said that having been a bad student for more than 20 years before coming to the US, he had never thought he would go into academia or rely on his studies to gain a foothold in a foreign country. After finishing biology, he decided to again apply for a postgraduate degree in statistics, making it easier to get internships and job opportunities. However, despite a lot of effort, he failed to receive a full scholarship, without which, the couple could not afford the high tuition.</span>

一路走来，就遇到非常非常多的贵人帮助。

<span style="color:grey">Along the way, I have met many, many kind people who were willing to help me.</span>

因为我12年嘛——就是在11年和13年我转到这个统计系之间——其实就有个小插曲。就是12年夏末的时候我开始做起了这个数学家教。之前有个朋友在那个地方做，然后他毕业走了，然后就介绍我去。

<span style="color:grey">In 2012 - that is, between 2011 and 2013 when I was in the midst of transferring to the statistics department - there was an interesting episode: in the late summer of 2012, I started to work as a math tutor for a family. I had a friend who was working there before he graduated and he referred me to replace him after he left.</span>

雇主是一家白人，就是富人家庭。就刚去，就感觉他们家很震撼了。进他家就得穿过一个幽静的树林，然后突然就开阔起来了。两边就是那种很经典的Windows开机屏幕那种开阔的草地一样的感觉。然后左右两片就是那个豪宅。路延伸到左边就是我家教的那家，右边就是美国前副总统拜登他家。他们家的姓叫Mellon，据说是美国最富有的家族，就是那个梅隆家族的一个分支的后裔。

<span style="color:grey">My employer was a rich white family. When I first went to their house, I was immediately shocked by its grandeur. To enter his house, you need to first cross a quiet woods and then, all of sudden, the field opens up. It looks like the classic Windows desktop picture. Then you'll see mansions on both sides of the field. The left one belongs to my employer and the right one belongs to the former US Vice President Joe Biden. My employer's family name is Mellon, which is said to be the wealthiest family in America and is a descendant of the Mellon family.</span>

那么我当时给他们家12岁多一点的大儿子教数学。很有礼貌的一个小孩，每次我去给他教课，他都会把水给我倒好，然后在书房等着我。走的时候会一路把我送到门口。我感觉他除了数学什么都强，会说英语、法语、德语，什么马术、钢琴、画画、潜水、滑雪都很强。

<span style="color:grey">I tutored math for their eldest son, who was a little over 12 years old. He was a very polite kid. Every time I went there, he would prepare the water for me and wait for me in the study, and when I left, he would accompany me all the way to the door. In fact, except math, it seems like he was good at everything. He spoke three languages, English, French, and German, and practiced equestrian, piano, painting, diving, and skiing.</span>

规定时间我从来没有一次缺席。就是两年多时间一直都是定时，该去的时候都去。美东这边经常下大雪，下了之后学校停课那种其实我都是去的。

<span style="color:grey">I had never been absent for over two years. Even when it snowed so heavily that the school was shut down, I  would still go.</span>

最开始的时候去教他，他儿子好像成绩提升挺快。他就请我和我老婆，和他们一家人一起去吃那种十几个course的饭。然后那个地方后面我去查了一下，差不多600美金一个人。我觉得他可能是为了怕我有那么大的压力，他就跟我说是很普通的一个地方，只是觉得好吃而已。

<span style="color:grey">After I started tutoring him, his grades seemed to have improved quickly. To express his gratitude, his father invited me and my wife to a fancy dinner that was composed of a dozen courses. I looked the place up myself and found that it cost almost 600 dollars per person. Afraid of putting any pressure on me, he told me it was just a homely restaurant that makes good food.</span>

当时我记得是在一个晚上，我教完那个小朋友课之后在他院子里面，他就问问他儿子的一些情况。聊完之后我就提了一个事情，那个时候正是在我收到统计系的这个offer，但是知道没有奖学金。我就跟他说，我有这么一个情况，能不能再找一些其他的事情。我说：“你看你们家的草坪这么大，我能不能来给你们割草？”

<span style="color:grey">One night after tutoring, I was chatting with him about his son in the garden. After finishing the topic, I mentioned to him about my admission to the statistics department and the lack of scholarship. I described the situation to him and asked him if there was any more work I could take on. I said, "Look, you have such a big lawn. Can I maintain it for you?"</span>

然后他就说：“How much money are we talking about?”

<span style="color:grey">He asked me, "How much money are we talking about?"</span>

我就给他说：“我还差个七八千块钱。”

<span style="color:grey">I told him, "I'm still $7,000-8,000 short."</span>

他说：“你等等。”他就回家直接写了一张一万的支票给我。

<span style="color:grey">He told me to wait, went inside the house, and came back with a check worth $10,000 for me.</span>

我当时就特别特别感动。他不光给我写了一张支票，还安排我做其他的事情，就比如说帮他洗他的那个私人飞机。他是那种商务的小型喷气式飞机，大概可以坐六到七个人，像一个大的卡车那么大。然后我就帮他洗飞机。

<span style="color:grey">I was very, very touched. In fact, he not only wrote me a check but also found other work for me, like washing his private jet. He owned a small business jet that could sit six or seven people and was as big as a truck. So I started washing it for him.</span>

他每去一个地方下飞机之后他就习惯开他自己的车，之前都是他把他车运到目的地，后面他就让我把他的车开到全国各个地方，他在哪下，然后就开到那儿等他，再坐他飞机回去。然后等他生意做完之后，再坐他飞机来，再把车开回去。甚至我还送他们家的猎犬去上那个summer camp。就做这种事情。他就给我找各种事情，然后还给我发钱。因为这些事情我才能凑够第一学期半学期的学费。

<span style="color:grey">Every time he flew to a new place, he preferred to drive his own car. Before he would have his car transported to his destination, but now he would ask me to drive his car to various parts of the country. Wherever he got off, I would drive his car to meet him there, and fly back on his jet. Then, after he has finished his business, I would return on his jet and drive his car back again. Aside from that, I would even take their dogs to the summer camp and do all sorts of these things. In short, he would find me all kinds of jobs and pay me accordingly. Thanks to them, I was able to earn enough money to pay the tuition for the first semester.</span>

又一个难关就过去了，就像玩游戏一样。一关一关的，RPG一样，你打了怪，提升了经验值，又面临更加强大了一个怪。

<span style="color:grey">Just like that, another obstacle was removed. It was like playing an RPG video game with one level after another. You beat a monster, gain some experience, and face an even more powerful one.</span>

从统计学专业毕业之后，白鞋进入了金融数据行业工作。两年前夫妻俩申请到绿卡，还有了一个可爱的女儿。他告诉我们这些年来遇到的最大的贵人就是他的太太，他们依靠着对彼此的信任克服了一个又一个的难关。接下来摆在他们眼前的就是女儿的成长和教育了。

<span style="color:grey">After graduating from statistics, White-Shoes went on to work in the financial industry. Two years ago, the couple received their green cards and had a lovely daughter. He told us that his biggest benefactor throughout these years is his wife. Thanks to their mutual trust, they have overcome one obstacle after another. Their focus now is the growth and education of their daughter.</span>

我们的第三个故事讨论的刚好就是这个话题。它的讲述者小D2001年大学毕业之后到悉尼留学，毕业之后不久就申请到了当地的永久居留权。小D现在还是一个妈妈，她的两个孩子都是在澳洲出生的，现在在读小学，是典型的ABC，也就是Australian-born Chinese——澳洲出生华人。

<span style="color:grey">Our third story is in fact about this topic. Its narrator, D, went to study in Sydney after graduating from college in 2001 and obtained her permanent residency shortly after graduation. D is now a mother of two children, both of whom were born in Australia. Now attending elementary school, they are typical ABCs, or Australian-born Chinese.</span>

我是小D，我生活在澳大利亚的悉尼，我的职业是会计。

<span style="color:grey">I'm D. I live in Sydney, Australia and I'm an accountant.</span>

我上学的时候也有同学是ABC嘛，我对他们的感觉是他们跟我不是一类人。总体ABC给我的感觉就都是很阳光，然后就很开朗，然后凡事都想得非常的简单。现在我跟着自己的小孩在经历一些小学的教育，我就明白为什么他们这么简单。他们真的是简单不是装的，也不是故意要装阳光，因为他们就从小到大接受的就是这种把事情简单化的教育。学校和老师给了规则，就是他们要rules嘛，那就规则就是规则，然后就按照规则来。如果别人越过了规则，那么你就会去挺身而出说：“哎，你这样做不对啊。因为不fair!”我们家小孩上学之后最爱说的一句话就是“It's not fair!”我简直那时候听这句话听得耳朵都出茧子了。

<span style="color:grey">When I was in school, some of my classmates were also ABCs and I felt that they were not at all like me. Overall they seemed to be very positive, very cheerful, and they never overthought about anything. Now that I am going through elementary school education with my own children, I started to understand why they appear so simple. They are indeed simple, not at all fake, nor are they deliberately trying to pretend to be positive. Growing up, they have always been receiving this kind of education that simplifies everything. The school and the teachers taught them all kinds of rules and they learned that rules are rules and they need to be followed. If someone has broken a rule, you should come forward and say, "Hey, you can't do that because it's not fair!" In fact, my kids' favorite argument is "It's not fair!" I must have heard of it a thousand times.</span>

小的时候他跟着我回国，他基本上就是吃吃喝喝喝嘛。然后亲戚朋友都很喜欢他，他们都会说：“哎呀，小老外回来了！”他也就觉得特别受宠。但是现在他长大了嘛，我觉得他就有很多自己的观点。

<span style="color:grey">When my son was little, he would follow me back to China on vacation, where he would basically eat all the time. All our relatives and friends adored him. They would say, "Look, the little *laowai* (literally meaning "old foreigner") is back!" and he would feel adored himself. But now that he has grown up a little, he started to develop his own opinions.</span>

然后小学生啊，他回国他就开始有自己的意见了。他回来时就会跟我说：“妈妈，我不喜欢他们不排队，而且他们总是撞人，撞了以后还不跟我说对不起。”我就觉得很矛盾，因为有的时候我知道他说的是对的，但是有时候我也觉得……就比如说他会跟我讲说：“妈妈，中国的车从来不让人。”就搞得我什么了。

<span style="color:grey">Now as an elementary school student, he began to have his own opinions when visiting China. Once we came back, he would tell me: "Mom, I didn't like that they didn't wait in a line, and they always bumped into people, and they never apologized to me when they bumped into me." I feel very conflicted as a result because sometimes I know that he is right but at the same time, I feel... For example, he would tell me: "Mom, Chinese drivers never wait for pedestrians." It makes me feel torn.</span>

就是有的时候我跟他一起上学路上，然后碰到我们俩走在一个路口的时候，有司机没有停，我就说：“Eason，你看到了！这个司机他也没有停！这是在澳大利亚，这在悉尼！”然后他就会用那种“你至于吗？”这种眼神看我一下。我们俩人经常就会有这种对抗。我就会说，“你看你说我的国家不好，其实你这里有的时候也会有，对不对？”

<span style="color:grey">Sometimes when I walk him to school, we would see a driver who didn't stop at an intersection, and I would point it out to him and say, “Eason, look! That driver didn’t stop either! And we are in Australia. We are in Sydney!" and he would give me this look that says "Seriously?" In fact, we often have this kind of argument where I would say, "Look, you said my country is not good, but sometimes we have the same problems here too, don't we?"</span>

他们在这长大嘛，你知道广东人他们会把外国人会叫鬼佬，然后我们不习惯这么叫，我们北方人一般就直接叫老外。我妈就是很习惯的说“老外”，到现在我妈也会说老外怎样怎样。可是我儿子每次听到都要纠正她说：“姥姥，他们不是老外。姥姥，你才是老外。”

<span style="color:grey">As they are growing up here... You know that Cantonese call foreigners *guilao*. We northerners are not used to that term, so we just call them *laowai*. My mom (who is living with us in Australia) is very used to calling them *laowai* and she does that even today. But every time my son heard of it, he would correct her and say, "Grandma, they are not *laowai*. Grandma, *you* are a *laowai*."</span>

这句话很伤我妈的感情，所以我后来就跟我儿子说：“你如果想纠正姥姥，请你只说‘姥姥，他们不是老外’，后面那句话就可以不用讲了。不要说‘姥姥，你才是老外’。”

<span style="color:grey">His remark hurt my mom's feelings, so I later said to him: "If you want to correct grandma, you can just say, 'Grandma, they are not *laowai*', without the second half. Don't add 'Grandma, *you* are a *laowai*.'"</span>

然后他就说：“但是这是事实啊！”

<span style="color:grey">He protested, "But it's the truth!"</span>

我说：“是事实，可是你不要讲，因为姥姥不喜欢听到你说“你才是老外”。这句话从你的嘴里说出来很伤人的。”

<span style="color:grey">I said, "Yes, it's the truth, but don't say it because grandma doesn't like it when you told her she is a *laowai*. Coming from you, it really hurts."</span>

他们就是很thoughtful，就是也替你想啊。他说：“那好，我就不讲了。”

<span style="color:grey">They are in fact very thoughtful and empathetic. He agreed, "Okay, I won't say it then."</span>

我妈也是改不了她的习惯，还会继续说“他们老外怎么”，“那天我碰到一个老外怎么怎么”。然后我儿子每次都会说：“他们不是老外。”他就是机械的重复一遍。

<span style="color:grey">My mom never changes her habit and continues to call the locals *laowai*. For example, she would say "I saw a *laowai* the other day" or whatever. And my son would continue to follow up mechanically with "They are not *laowai*." Period.</span>

有一次我就跟他——是因为什么，看一个什么体育比赛还是什么的——然后刚好那个比赛有中国，我就说：“那我替中国加油，你替澳大利亚加油。”

<span style="color:grey">One time I was watching a sports game or something with him and it happened to be a game involving the team of China, so I said: "I will cheer for China, and you can cheer for Australia."</span>

然后他就说：“为什么？难道你不是澳大利亚人吗？”

<span style="color:grey">He asked me, "Why? Aren't you Australian?"</span>

我就随口说：“我真的不是啊，因为我的护照的颜色都给你的不一样啊。”

<span style="color:grey">I responded casually: "No, in fact I'm not. Even my passport has a different color from yours."</span>

他当时的表情就是简直震惊到家了。“妈妈，你不是澳大利亚人？”

<span style="color:grey">He was completely shocked. "Mom, you are not Australian?"</span>

我说：“我不是呀！”

<span style="color:grey">"I'm not!"</span>

“怎么可能？你是个外国人！”

<span style="color:grey">"How come? You are a foreigner!"</span>

然后我说：“我跟姥姥一样是个外国人啊！”我当时真的是有恶作剧的心情。然后我说：“告诉你个事实：你爸爸也不是哦！”因为我老公跟我一样都是拿永居，没有换成澳大利亚护照。

<span style="color:grey">I ensured him, "Yes, I am a foreigner just like grandma!" Mischievously, I continued, "Let me tell you another fact: your dad is not Australian either!" My husband and I are both permanent residents. We never applied for citizenship.</span>

他们俩人就有种天塌下来的感觉，我当时笑死。

<span style="color:grey">My kids reacted as if the sky was falling down. I couldn't stop laughing.</span>

后来我就跟他们解释这之间的关系，我说：“其实你看我也纳税，然后我所有东西都可以，然后我说只是没有选举权。”

<span style="color:grey">Later, I explained to them the intricacies of resident status. I said, "You see, I also pay taxes, and I can do practically everything except that I have no right to vote."</span>

他就问我说：“所以Prime Minister你是不能选的吗？”

<span style="color:grey">So they asked me, "So you can't vote for the Prime Minister?"</span>

我说：“不能。”

<span style="color:grey">"No, I can't."</span>

然后他们说：“那你太可怜了！”

<span style="color:grey">They exclaimed, "How pitiful!"</span>

我想说：“我也不觉得自己很可怜啊。需要这么可怜吗？不过就是不能选总理啊。”

<span style="color:grey">I thought to myself, "I don't feel pitiful myself. Should I? I just can't vote for the Prime Minister."</span>

然后他们说：“那妈妈，每一次那个社区选举（他们除了总理还有那个社区的议会啊什么，就这种选举，区议员选举什么的），以前区议员来敲门的时候，就拉选票嘛，我看你跟人家聊得很好嘛。你跟他说了很多。”

<span style="color:grey">Then they said, "Mom, every time there was a community election (in addition to voting for Prime Ministers, they also organize elections for community representatives, etc.), when candidates knocked on our door to gain support, you always talked to them, a lot in fact."</span>

我说：“对呀，我表达的是我作为住在这个社区的人的意见而已嘛。”

<span style="color:grey">I replied, "Yes, I was just trying to express my opinions as someone who lives in the community."</span>

然后他说：“但是你其实不能投票！”

<span style="color:grey">They argued, "But you can't vote!"</span>

我说：“对，我不能投票。但是他又不知道！”

<span style="color:grey">I admitted, "Yes, I can't vote, but they don't know!"</span>

我儿子就是那种特别鄙视的表情。我儿子就说：“妈妈，下次他们在敲门我就会跟他们说：‘My mom can't vote.’我就直接这么告诉他们。”

<span style="color:grey">My son looked at me disapprovingly and said, "Mom, the next time they knock on the door, I will tell them: ‘My mom can't vote.’ I will tell them directly like this.”</span>

我说：“无所谓啊，你喜欢讲就讲啊。”我们俩人经常就会有这样很赌气的对话。

<span style="color:grey">I said, "Whatever, do what you want." We often talked to each other in a bickering tone like this.</span>

希望他们的中文能再好一点。我希望她们能够简短的读懂中文的新闻，读中文字幕没有什么困难，能读懂一些比较短篇的小说啊，不带古文的一些简单的通俗的这些小说就可以了。但这要求真的很高，这要求真的很高。读懂小说这件事情就是，我女儿就跟我说这绝对是一个不可能发生在她生命中的事情。她直接就这样跟我们讲。

<span style="color:grey">I hope their Chinese will improve. I hope that they can read the Chinese news, the Chinese subtitles without many difficulties and that they can read some short novels - the simple modern ones, not the ancient ones. But this turned out to be a very high expectation. When it comes to reading a  Chinese novel, my daughter told us frankly that it wouldn't happen in her lifetime.</span>

但是有的时候可能是自我安慰吧，我也曾安慰自己说：他们不能在我的语言里面感受到这种文化也好、或者说故事也好、情节也好、感情也好，各种那种feeling吧，他们感受不到。但是我相信英语文化里面也有，就是好像他们读Shakespeare肯定比我读得好啊。

<span style="color:grey">Sometimes as a kind of self-consolation, I would tell myself that even though they can't feel this culture in my language, or a story, a plot, a feeling or whatever, I believe there are equivalent sentiments in the English language as well. For example, I'm sure they read Shakespeare better than I do.</span>

有一次我女儿就跟我讲罗密欧与朱丽叶，因为她那时听完罗密欧与朱丽叶（当然是减版的，没有很多血腥的）。他们看完后两个人就跟我说他们的感受啊怎样的时候，然后我就想起来问他们——因为我跟他们讲过梁祝的故事嘛——我就问他们，我说：“你觉得梁祝让你比较伤心啊，还是罗密欧与朱丽叶比较让你伤心？”

<span style="color:grey">One time my daughter was telling me about Romeo and Juliet because she had just heard of the story (of course, it was the reduced version, not as bloody as the original). As the two of them were telling me how they felt after hearing the story, I remembered having told them the Chinese tale of [Liang Zhu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_Lovers) myself. So I asked them: "Does Liang Zhu make you sadder or Romeo and Juliet does?"</span>

他们两个同时给我的答案都是他们觉得罗密欧与朱丽叶比较悲惨。

<span style="color:grey">They responded simultaneously that Romeo and Juliet made them sadder.</span>

然后我就问他们为什么。结果他们俩跟我说，就很直观说：“因为罗密欧与朱丽叶都死了，梁祝他们没死啊！他们变成蝴蝶，还在一起飞走了！他们活着的啊！”

<span style="color:grey">So I asked them why. Matter-of-factly, they told me: "Because both Romeo and Juliet died in the end, but neither Liang nor Zhu did! Instead, they became butterflies and flew away together! They lived!"</span>

所以你看小孩的视角真的很有意思，因为他们觉得变成蝴蝶，然后还活着，跟死掉就是两件事情。我是把它当成一个悲剧看的，毕竟我受这个文化熏陶嘛，我们都知道梁祝是个悲剧故事嘛，就算喜剧结尾它总体还是个悲剧嘛。但他们觉得这是个大好结局，而且还变成蝴蝶！我女儿的那个语气就是“变蝴蝶多开心，我想变还变不了！”我就觉得这真的是可能是文化碰撞里面不一样。

<span style="color:grey">So you see, it's really interesting to see something from a kid's perspective. In their mind, since the characters had transformed into butterflies, living butterflies, it's absolutely different from dying. I saw the tale as a tragedy because, after all, I was influenced by my culture. We all know that Liang Zhu is a tragic story. Even though it ends with a happy ending, it is still a tragedy. But they think it's a *great* ending. And butterflies! My daughter seemed to be saying "How happy it is to become a butterfly! I can't even if I want to!" Such is the difference between cultures.</span>

我当然是希望他们能够跟我有共同的地方越多越好，因为他们是我的小孩嘛。但是没有办法，他们出生地点就在这里，这是他们文化氛围啊。

<span style="color:grey">Of course, I hope that they have more in common with me because, after all, they are *my* children. But it's not easy. They were born here and this is their culture.</span>

后来我也有跟——就是孩子出生在这里，已经长了很大的——比我年龄再大一些的华人的父母聊嘛，他们就说在这边出生的小孩都有一个对自己的父母的国家的认同的过程，一定会有的。然后他们说等他们再大一点，你再带他们去故宫啊什么，他们懂这些的时候，他们会有些回归的。当然这种文化认同是没有办法跟我们这种出生在中国的人比的，可是还是要看你怎么帮他，就是你怎么帮他去认同。

<span style="color:grey">Later on, I met a few Chinese parents who were older than I was and had children who were born here and had already grown up. They told me that immigrant children all go through a process of acknowledging and accepting their parents' countries. They all do. They told me to wait until they are a bit older to take them to places like  [the Forbidden City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbidden_City). Once they understand these things, they will accept them more easily. Of course, their cultural identity is by no means as strong as that of people like us who were born in China, but it still depends on how you help them identify it.</span>
